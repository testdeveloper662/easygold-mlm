        <div class="section-title section-gap">1. Subscription</div>
        <div class="sub-section">
            (a)The undersigned investor (the “Subscriber”) hereby irrevocably subscribes for and agrees to purchase
            EASYGOLD Tokens (the “Tokens” or “Securities”) of Hartmann & Benz, LLC, a District of Columbia limited
            liability company (the “Company”), at a purchase price of $1.00 per Token (the “Per Security Price”). The
            minimum subscription amount is $500 (i.e., 500 Tokens) for Accredited Investors (as defined in Rule 501 of
            Regulation D under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”)), or $500 (500 Tokens)
            in transactions made outside the United States to persons who are not “U.S. Persons” (as defined in
            Regulation S under the Securities Act), pursuant to Regulation S.
        </div>
        <div class="sub-section">
            (b)The Subscriber understands that the Securities are being offered pursuant to a private placement
            memorandum dated November 15, 2022 (the “Memorandum”), and that the Securities have not been and will not be
            registered under the Securities Act. By executing this Subscription Agreement, the Subscriber acknowledges
            that the Subscriber has received this Subscription Agreement, a copy of the Memorandum (including all
            exhibits thereto), and any other information that the Subscriber has requested or deemed necessary to make
            an informed investment decision.
        </div>
        <div class="sub-section">
            (c)The Subscriber’s subscription may be accepted or rejected, in whole or in part, by the Company in its
            sole discretion at any time. The Company may also decide, in its sole discretion, to allocate to the
            Subscriber only a portion of the Tokens that the Subscriber has subscribed for. The Company will notify the
            Subscriber whether the subscription has been accepted (in whole or in part) or rejected. If the Subscriber’s
            subscription is rejected (in whole or in part), the Subscriber’s payment (or the applicable rejected portion
            of such payment) will be returned without interest, and all obligations of the Subscriber under this
            Agreement with respect to that rejected portion shall terminate. The Subscriber acknowledges and agrees
            that: (i) any returned funds may be returned in U.S. Dollars, regardless of the form of the Subscriber’s
            initial payment; (ii) if the Subscriber paid with gold bars accepted by the Company, the Company is
            authorized to convert such gold into U.S. Dollars at the then-applicable conversion rate at any time after
            receipt; and (iii) if any payment in gold bars is converted into U.S. Dollars, the Company will not be
            liable for any fluctuation in the price of gold during the period in which the Subscriber’s funds (or the
            proceeds thereof) were held by the Company or on the Company’s behalf.
        </div>

        <div class="sub-section">
            (d)The aggregate number of Tokens offered for sale shall not exceed 600,000,000 Tokens (the “Maximum
            Offering”). The Company may continue to accept subscriptions for the Tokens until the earliest of: (i) the
            date on which the Maximum Offering has been fully subscribed; (ii) the date on which a registered offering
            under Regulation A+ is qualified by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”); or (iii) the date
            on which the Company elects, in its sole discretion and in accordance with applicable SEC regulations, to
            terminate or extend this offering. This offering of Tokens is being conducted on a “best efforts” basis
            pursuant to Rule 251(d) (3)(i)(F) of Regulation A, meaning there is no guarantee that any minimum amount of
            Tokens will be sold.
        </div>

        <div class="sub-section">
            (e)If this subscription is rejected in its entirety, or if the sale of the Securities (or any portion
            thereof) is not consummated for any reason, then this Subscription Agreement shall be void and of no further
            force or effect, except that Section 5 (Survival of Representations and Indemnity) shall remain in effect.

        <div class="section-title section-gap">2. Purchase Procedure</div>
        <div class="sub-section">
            The full purchase price for the subscribed Tokens must be paid by the Subscriber at the time the Subscriber
            signs and delivers this Subscription Agreement to the Company. Payment shall be made in immediately
            available funds by wire transfer, ACH, delivery of gold bars (as permitted by the Company), or other method
            approved by the Company (which may include payment in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ether to a wallet
            address designated by the Company), using the payment instructions provided by the Company.
        </div>
        <div class="sub-section">
            Upon the Company’s acceptance of the Subscriber’s subscription, the Company will promptly provide the
            Subscriber with a confirmation of acceptance. The Tokens purchased by the Subscriber will then be delivered
            to the ERC-1400 compatible digital wallet address provided by the Subscriber

            complete in all material respects as of the date of the closing of the Subscriber’s purchase of Tokens,
            except as otherwise disclosed in writing to the Subscriber. For purposes of this Agreement, an individual is
            deemed to have “knowledge” of a fact or matter if that individual is actually aware of the fact or matter.
            The Company will be deemed to have “knowledge” of a fact or matter if any of the Company’s current officers
            has, or at any time had, actual knowledge of such fact or matter.
        </div>
        <div class="sub-section">
            <strong>(a)Organization and Standing.</strong> The Company is a limited liability company duly formed,
            validly existing, and in good standing under the laws of the District of Columbia. The Company is also duly
            qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign limited liability company in each other
            jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or properties requires such qualification, except for any
            jurisdiction where the failure to be so qualified would not have a material adverse effect on the Company or
            its business.
        </div>
        <div class="sub-section">
            <strong>(b)Issuance of Securities.</strong>The issuance, sale, and delivery of the Tokens under this
            Subscription Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary company action on the part of the Company.
            When the Tokens are issued, sold, and delivered against payment in accordance with the terms of this
            Agreement, they will be validly issued, fully paid, and non-assessable.
        </div>
        <div class="sub-section">
            <strong>(c)Authority and Enforceability. </strong>The Company has full power and authority to execute and
            deliver this Subscription Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated herein (including the
            issuance and sale of the Tokens). This Subscription Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the
            Company and, upon execution of this Agreement by all parties, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of
            the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to: (i) applicable
            bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, or similar laws affecting creditors’ rights generally;
            (ii) general principles of equity (including principles limiting the availability of specific performance,
            injunctive relief, or other equitable remedies), regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding
            at law or in equity; and (iii) limitations on indemnification and contribution that may be imposed by
            applicable law or public policy (including federal or state securities laws).

            claim, charge, or investigation pending against the Company, or, to the Company’s knowledge, currently
            threatened in writing against the Company. Further, to the Company’s knowledge, no such action or proceeding
            is pending or has been threatened in writing against any consultant, officer, manager, director, or key
            employee of the Company in connection with that person’s relationship with the Company, which action, if
            resolved adversely, would reasonably be expected to materially affect the Company.

            to the Company that each of the following statements is true and correct in all material respects as of the
