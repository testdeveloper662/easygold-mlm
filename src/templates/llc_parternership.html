        PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT FOR INTRODUCER<br>
        HARTMANN & BENZ, LLC
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <p class="section-gap"><strong>This Partnership Agreement</strong> (the "Agreement") is made and entered into as
            of <strong>({{date}})</strong> (the "Effective Date"), by and between <strong> Hartmann & Benz,
                LLC</strong>, a limited liability company organized under the laws of the District of Columbia, with its
            principal office at 1717 N Street, NW, STE 1, Washington, District of Columbia, 20036, United States
            <strong>("Company")</strong>, and <strong>{{name}}</strong>, a <strong>{{entity}}</strong> with an
            address at <strong>{{address}}</strong> (<strong>"Partner"</strong>). Company and Partner are each referred
            to herein as a "Party" and collectively as the "Parties."
        </p>

        <p class="section-gap"><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, Company is engaged in business activities that may require
            raising capital and seeks assistance in identifying potential investors or sources of investment funding;
        </p>
        <p class="section-gap"><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, Partner has experience, contacts, and relationships that may be
            useful in introducing potential investors to Company, and Partner is willing to provide such introduction
            services on a non-exclusive, independent contractor basis;</p>
        <p class="section-gap"><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, Partner is not a licensed broker-dealer or investment advisor,
            and the Parties intend to ensure that Partner’s activities under this Agreement are limited to those
            permissible for an unregistered finder and do not require any form of broker-dealer or investment advisor
            registration;</p>

        <p class="section-gap"><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, the Parties wish to set forth the terms and conditions of
            Partner’s introduction services, including a commission-based compensation structure tied to successful
            investments raised, while <strong>explicitly defining the independent nature of the relationship</strong>
            and including necessary disclosures, liability protections, indemnifications, and compliance provisions to
            mitigate regulatory and legal risk;
        </p>

        <p class="section-gap"><strong>NOW, THEREFORE</strong>, in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants
            herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
            acknowledged, the Parties hereby agree as follows:</p>

        <div class="section-title section-gap">1. Engagement and Scope of Services</div>
        <div class="sub-section">
            <strong>1.1 Services.</strong> Company hereby engages Partner, and Partner agrees, to act as a non-exclusive
            introducer of potential investors to Company (the “Services”). Partner’s Services are limited to identifying
            and introducing to Company prospective investors who may have an interest in investing in Company or its
            projects. Partner shall not have authority to negotiate or conclude any investment or transaction on behalf
            of Company, but will facilitate initial contact and meetings between interested investors and Company.
        </div>
        <div class="sub-section">
            <strong>1.2 Introductions.</strong> An “Introduction” under this Agreement shall occur when Partner provides
            Company with the name and contact information of a prospective investor not already known to or in contact
            with Company, and arranges initial communication between Company and such investor. The Parties may mutually
            pre- approve in writing each prospective investor to be introduced by Partner under this Agreement to avoid
            duplication or conflicts. Company reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to accept or reject any
            potential investor introduced by Partner.
        </div>
        <div class="sub-section">
            <strong>1.3 Non-Exclusivity.</strong> The Parties acknowledge and agree that this Agreement is
            non-exclusive. Company may engage other finders, consultants, brokers, or agents to seek investment, and
            Partner may perform similar introduction or consulting services for other entities, provided that (a)
            Partner continues to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement, (b) no Confidential Information (as
            defined herein) of Company is used or disclosed in breach of this Agreement, and (c) any such other
            activities do not pose a conflict of interest or breach of Partner’s duties hereunder.
        </div>

        <div class="sub-section">
            <strong>1.4 Independent Efforts.</strong> Nothing in this Agreement obligates Company to consummate an
            investment with any investor introduced by Partner. Company retains sole discretion over whether and on what
            terms to enter into any investment or transaction with a prospective investor introduced by Partner.
            Partner’s role is limited to making introductions, and Partner acknowledges that Company may decline to
            pursue any particular opportunity with an introduced investor for any reason.
        </div>

        <div class="section-title section-gap">2. Independent Contractor Relationship</div>
        <div class="sub-section">
            <strong>2.1 Independent Contractor.</strong> Partner is engaged by Company as an independent contractor for
            the sole purpose of performing the Services described in this Agreement. No employment, partnership, joint
            venture, or agency relationship is created by this Agreement, and neither Party shall hold itself out as an
            employee, agent, affiliate, or representative of the other. Partner has no authority to bind Company to any
            contract, commitment, or obligation, and shall not represent to any third party that Partner has any such
            authority.
        </div>
        <div class="sub-section">
            <strong>2.2 No Benefits; Taxes.</strong> As an independent contractor, Partner shall not be eligible for,
            nor entitled to, any benefits that Company provides to its employees (such as salary, insurance, paid leave,
            or retirement benefits). Partner is solely responsible for all taxes, withholdings, and other statutory or
            contractual obligations of any sort (including, without limitation, income tax, Social Security, Medicare,
            self-employment taxes, unemployment insurance, and workers’ compensation coverage) with respect to the
            compensation received under this Agreement. No withholding will be made by Company for any taxes or
            contributions; all such taxes and charges are the sole responsibility of Partner, and Partner shall file and
            pay them as required by law. Partner shall indemnify and hold Company harmless from any claims, liabilities,
            or penalties imposed on Company for failure to withhold or pay any taxes or fees on amounts paid to Partner,
            as further provided in Section 11.
        </div>
        <div class="sub-section">
            <strong>2.3 Control of Work.</strong> Partner shall retain sole and absolute discretion in the manner and
            means of carrying out the Services, subject to the terms of this Agreement. Partner will use Partner’s own
            tools, resources, and work methods, and is free to arrange Partner’s work schedule; however, Partner agrees
            to perform the Services in a professional manner consistent with industry standards and any guidelines
            provided by Company. Partner is not required to work exclusively for Company and may be engaged in other
            business activities, provided that such activities do not conflict or interfere with the performance of
            Services under this Agreement.
        </div>

        <div class="section-title section-gap">3. No Partnership or Agency</div>
        <div class="sub-section">The Parties expressly agree that no partnership, joint venture, or other fiduciary
            relationship is created between them by this Agreement. The use of the term “Partnership” in the title or
            any other provision of this Agreement is for convenience only, reflecting a collaborative effort, and does
            not denote a legal partnership. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as creating a partnership,
            joint venture, or fiduciary relationship between Company and Partner, or as granting either Party the
            authority to act as an agent for or on behalf of the other. Each Party is responsible for its own expenses,
            direction, and management, and neither Party may incur obligations on behalf of the other without express
            written consent. For avoidance of doubt, neither Party has the authority to bind or obligate the other in
            any contract or agreement without the express prior written authorization of the Party to be bound. Both
            Parties acknowledge that no agency or fiduciary duty exists between them, and each Party shall be solely
            responsible for its own actions and the conduct of its employees or agents.</div>

        <div class="section-title section-gap">4. No Investment Advisor or Broker-Dealer Status</div>
        <div class="sub-section">
            <strong>4.1 No Broker-Dealer or Advisor.</strong> Partner represents and warrants that Partner is not a
            registered brokerdealer, broker, dealer, investment banker, financial advisor, or investment adviser, and is
            not an associated person of a broker-dealer, under U.S. federal or state securities laws. Partner is
            entering into this Agreement on the express condition that the Services (introductions of potential
            investors) do not require such registration or licensing. Partner shall not perform any act or provide any
            service hereunder for which such a license or registration is required. Specifically, Partner will not
            engage in any negotiations of investment terms, provide any investment recommendation or advice to any
            investor or Company, solicit or handle funds or securities, and will not perform any other activities that
            would require registration as a broker, dealer, or investment adviser under applicable law.
        </div>
        <div class="sub-section">
            <strong>4.2 Finder’s Capacity.</strong> The Parties agree and acknowledge that Partner’s role is solely that
            of a “finder” or introducer. In providing the Services, Partner will act strictly in a limited capacity to
            introduce Company to prospective investors with whom Partner has pre-existing relationships, in exchange for
            the compensation set forth herein. Partner shall not market or offer any securities of Company for sale to
            the public, and shall not hold itself out to any person as having authority to make representations on
            behalf of Company beyond those made in written materials approved by Company. It is understood that Partner
            is not a licensed broker-dealer or an investment banking firm and shall not act in such a capacity. All
            investment decisions and securities transactions will be negotiated and consummated directly between Company
            and the investor (or through Company’s designated professionals), and nothing in this Agreement contemplates
            Partner’s participation in the offer, sale, or purchase of securities beyond the initial introduction.
        </div>
        <div class="sub-section">
            <strong>4.3 No Investment Advice or Recommendations.</strong> Partner will not provide any financial, legal,
            or investment advice to any prospective investor as part of the Services. Partner shall not make any
            representations regarding the merits or potential future performance of Company or any investment, and
            <strong>shall not recommend or urge</strong> any particular investment decision to any prospective investor.
            All Parties acknowledge that each prospective investor must rely solely on the Company’s own information and
            disclosures and on the investor’s own due diligence, analysis, and advisors for any investment decision.
            Partner may provide prospective investors with <strong>Company-approved materials</strong> or information
            expressly authorized by Company for dissemination, but Partner shall not add any commentary, opinion, or
            analysis regarding any such opportunity that might be construed as investment advice. Each Party hereto is
            responsible for its own decisions and should seek independent professional advice as needed.
        </div>
        <div class="sub-section">
            <strong>4.4 Regulatory Compliance.</strong> The Parties intend to conduct their relationship and any
            introductions in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, including U.S. federal and state
            securities laws. Company represents that it will conduct any offering or sale of securities in compliance
            with an applicable exemption from registration (such as a private placement under Regulation D, etc.), and
            Company will not knowingly violate any securities laws in accepting investments from investors introduced by
            Partner. Partner agrees to comply with all applicable laws in performing the Services and will not take any
            action that would jeopardize the availability of any securities law exemption or cause either Party to be in
            violation of law. In particular, if the Company’s offering is a private placement, Partner shall not engage
            in any form of general solicitation or general advertising not permitted under applicable law. Partner will
            limit introductions to investors with whom Partner has a substantive pre-existing relationship or whom
            Partner reasonably believes to be “accredited investors” or otherwise qualified under applicable law, as
            instructed by Company. Partner shall immediately notify Company if Partner is approached by any regulator or
            other authority regarding any aspect of this Agreement or the introductions made hereunder.
        </div>
        <div class="sub-section">
            <strong>4.5 No Illegal Payments.</strong> Partner and Company each represent that no payment or compensation
            to be provided under this Agreement is in return for any illegal or unethical act, and neither Party will,
            directly or indirectly, offer, pay, solicit, or accept any money or anything of value as a bribe, kickback,
            or other improper influence in connection with any investment. Any compensation paid to Partner hereunder is
            solely for the introduction Services and not for the actual purchase or sale of any security.
        </div>

        <div class="section-title section-gap">5. Compensation (Commission)</div>
        <div class="sub-section">
            <strong>5.1. Success Fee/Commission.</strong> As compensation for the Services, Company shall pay Partner a
            commissionbased success fee (the “Commission”) for each Successful Investment that is made by an investor
            introduced by Partner. A “Successful Investment” means that during the Term of this Agreement or within the
            applicable Tail Period after termination (as defined below), Company receives a capital investment (whether
            equity, debt, or other financing as agreed) from an Introduced Investor (defined as a prospective investor
            introduced by Partner under this Agreement who was not already in Company’s pipeline or known to Company
            prior to introduction). The Commission shall be calculated as follows:
        </div>
        <div class="numrow section-gap">
            <div class="num">a.</div>
            <div class="content"><span class="bold-content">Commission Rate.</span> Partner shall be entitled to a
                commission equal to % (5 percent) of the total gross amount of capital investment actually received by
                Company from the Introduced Investor as part of the initial investment transaction. (For example, if an
                Introduced Investor invests $1,000,000 in Company, Partner would earn a commission of $50.000) The
                specific percentage may vary for different investors or transactions only if agreed in writing by the
                Parties in advance of the investment.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="numrow section-gap">
            <div class="num">a.</div>
            <div class="content"><span class="bold-content">Success Event.</span> The Commission is deemed earned by
                Partner only upon the closing of a transaction in which Company receives the investment funds from an
                Introduced Investor (or, if the investment involves multiple closings or tranches, as each closing
                occurs, proportional to the funds received at that closing). No Commission is due for introductions that
                do not result in an actual investment in Company. For clarity, mere introduction alone does not trigger
                any payment; the compensation is strictly contingent upon the Company’s receipt of investment capital
                from an Introduced Investor as a direct result of the Partner’s introduction.
            </div>
        </div>

            <div class="num">a.</div>
            <div class="content"><span class="bold-content">Payment Timing.</span> Company shall pay the earned
                Commission to Partner promptly following the closing and receipt of funds for a Successful Investment.
                Unless otherwise agreed in writing, payment of the Commission shall be due within 10 business days after
                Company’s receipt of the investment funds. The Commission shall be paid by wire transfer or other
                immediately available funds to an account designated by Partner, after receipt of an invoice or payment
                request from Partner (if customarily required by Company’s accounts payable procedures).

            <div class="num">a.</div>
            <div class="content"><span class="bold-content">Multiple Closings or Follow-on Investments.</span> If an
                Introduced Investor makes multiple investments or follow-on investments in Company (e.g., in subsequent
                financing rounds) during the Term or Tail Period, those subsequent investments shall also be considered
                in determining additional Commission owed to Partner, unless such investor was separately introduced by
                another party for the subsequent transaction or the Parties agree otherwise in writing. Unless otherwise
                agreed, the same Commission Rate shall apply to any subsequent investment by the same Introduced
                Investor consummated within the Tail Period or while this Agreement is in effect.
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="sub-section">
            <strong>5.2. Tail Period.</strong> In order to protect Partner’s interest in introductions made, the Parties
            agree that if this Agreement expires or is terminated for any reason, Partner shall still be entitled to the
            Commission for any investment made by an Introduced Investor within <strong>eighteen (18) months</strong>
            after the termination or expiration of the Agreement (the “Tail Period”), provided that the initial
            introduction of such investor by Partner to Company occurred during the Term of this Agreement. In other
            words, Company’s obligation to pay Commissions to Partner with respect to any particular Introduced Investor
            shall survive the termination of this Agreement for a period of 18 months. If an investment from an

            Partner shall be paid the applicable Commission as set forth in this Section 5, as though this Agreement
            were still in effect. However, no Commission shall be payable to Partner under this provision if: (a) prior
            to Partner’s introduction, Company was already in bona fide negotiations or discussions with the investor
            about a potential investment (as evidenced by written records) or had previously been introduced to the
            investor by a third party; or (b) the investment by the investor is not in any way attributable to Partner’s

        <div class="sub-section">
            <strong>6.1. Definition of Confidential Information.</strong> “Confidential Information” means any
            non-public, proprietary or confidential information disclosed by or on behalf of one Party (the “Disclosing
            Party”) to the other Party (the “Receiving Party”), whether disclosed in writing, orally, electronically, or
            by any other means, that is either identified as confidential at the time of disclosure or that should
            reasonably be understood to be confidential given the nature of the information and the context of
            disclosure. Confidential Information of Company includes, without limitation, information about Company’s
            business plans, strategies, financial projections or results, operations, products, services, intellectual
            property, trade secrets, know-how, customers, partners, investors (including information about any potential
            or actual investors introduced hereunder), and any offering materials, contracts or transaction terms
            related to potential investments. <strong>Information of Partner</strong> includes, as applicable, Partner’s
            own proprietary business information (excluding any business contact information or relationships that
            Partner is leveraging for introductions, which Company may use for the purposes of evaluating and pursuing
            investments). The <strong>existence and terms of this Agreement</strong> are also deemed Confidential
            Information of both Parties.
        </div>
        <div class="sub-section">
            <strong>6.2. Exclusions.</strong> Information shall not be considered Confidential Information to the extent
            that the Receiving Party can prove by competent evidence that such information: (a) is or becomes generally
            available to the public through no breach of this Agreement or wrongful act of the Receiving Party; (b) was
            independently developed by the Receiving Party without use of or reference to any Confidential Information
            of the Disclosing Party and without any breach of this Agreement; (c) was rightfully received by the
            Receiving Party from a third party who is not under any obligation of confidentiality with respect to such
            information; or (d) was known to the Receiving Party prior to disclosure by the Disclosing Party free of any
            obligation of confidentiality.

            same degree of care to protect it as the Receiving Party uses to protect its own confidential information of
            a similar nature, but in no event less than reasonable care. The Receiving Party agrees not to use
            Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party for any purpose except for fulfilling its obligations or
            exercising its rights under this Agreement, and not to disclose such Confidential Information to any third
            party except to such of its own directors, officers, employees, agents, or advisors who have a need to know
            it for the aforementioned purpose and who are bound by confidentiality obligations at least as protective as
            those in this Agreement. The Receiving Party shall be responsible for any breach of confidentiality by any
            person to whom it discloses the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information.

            If the Receiving Party is required by law, regulation, or court order to disclose any of the Disclosing
            Party’s Confidential Information, the Receiving Party shall (to the extent permitted by law) promptly notify
            the Disclosing Party in writing of such requirement so that the Disclosing Party may seek an appropriate
            protective order or other remedy. The Receiving Party will reasonably cooperate with the Disclosing Party in
            seeking such protection at the Disclosing Party’s expense. If disclosure is still required, the Receiving
            Party shall disclose only that portion of the Confidential Information legally required to be disclosed and
            shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that any Confidential Information so disclosed is
            accorded confidential treatment.
        </div>

        <div class="sub-section" style="text-align: justify;">
            <strong>6.5. Return or Destruction.</strong>
            Upon the written request of the Disclosing Party at any time, and in any event upon termination of this
            Agreement, the Receiving Party shall promptly return to the Disclosing Party or destroy (at the Disclosing
            Party’s election) all materials in any form embodying or reflecting any of the Disclosing Party’s
            Confidential Information that the Receiving Party still maintains or controls, and shall certify in writing
            to the Disclosing Party its compliance with the foregoing (provided that the Receiving Party may retain
            copies of Confidential Information as required by law or for routine backup and record-keeping purposes,

            Each Party agrees not to disclose the existence or terms of this Agreement to any third party without the
            prior written consent of the other Party, except (i) to such Party’s legal, financial, or tax advisors who
            have a need to know and are bound by confidentiality, (ii) as required by law or regulatory authority (in
            which case, to the extent practicable, the disclosing Party shall inform the other Party in advance), or
            (iii) in confidence in connection with an actual or potential merger, acquisition, or sale of assets or
            business (including due diligence related thereto). The Parties acknowledge that maintaining the
            confidentiality of this Agreement is a material consideration and part of their mutual undertaking.

            <strong>three (3) years</strong> from the date of such termination or expiration, or for so long as the
            Confidential Information remains a trade secret under applicable law, whichever is longer. Notwithstanding
            the foregoing, any investor lists or personal data that may be exchanged should be treated in accordance
            with any applicable privacy laws indefinitely, and Company’s obligations to not disclose Partner’s

        <div class="sub-section" style="text-align: justify;">
            <strong>7.1. Mutual Authority.</strong>
            Each Party represents and warrants that it is fully authorized and empowered to enter into this Agreement
            and that doing so will not violate any other agreement or obligation by which it is bound. The individual
            signing on behalf of each Party (and for Partner, the Partner themselves if an individual) represents that
            they have full legal authority to bind that Party to this Agreement.
        </div>

        <div class="sub-section" style="text-align: justify;">
            <strong>7.2. No Conflicts.</strong>
            Each Party represents that the performance of its obligations under this Agreement will not breach any other
            agreement to which it is a party or by which it is bound, and that it is not a party to any agreement in
            conflict with this Agreement. Partner specifically represents that Partner is not subject to any noncompete,
            non-solicitation, or other restriction that would prevent Partner from lawfully performing the Services for
            Company.
        </div>

        <div class="sub-section" style="text-align: justify;">
            <strong>7.3. Compliance with Laws.</strong>
            Each Party represents that it will comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and ordinances in
            connection with its performance under this Agreement. Partner represents that Partner’s performance of the
            Services (including any introductions of investors and any related communications) will be conducted in
            compliance with all applicable federal and state securities laws and regulations. Partner further represents
            that Partner is not subject to any order, judgment, or decree of any governmental authority that would
            prohibit or restrict Partner from engaging in the activities contemplated by this Agreement, and that
            Partner has not, to Partner’s knowledge, been the subject of any regulatory investigation or enforcement
            action regarding securities or financial matters. Company represents that any materials, statements, or
            financial information it provides to Partner for use in introductions will be, to the best of Company’s
            knowledge, true, accurate, and not misleading in all material respects and will not omit any material facts
            necessary to make any provided information not misleading. Company further represents that, to its
            knowledge, it is not in violation of any law or subject to any investigation or proceeding that would
            adversely affect its ability to engage in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
        </div>
        <div class="sub-section" style="text-align: justify;">
            <strong>7.4. No Warranty of Success.</strong>
            Partner acknowledges that Company makes no guarantees that any introduction will result in a completed
            investment or that Company will accept investment from any Introduced Investor. Company likewise
            acknowledges that Partner makes no guarantee that it will successfully identify investors willing to invest
            in Company. Both Parties agree that outcomes are uncertain and that each introduced opportunity is subject
            to risks and independent decisions by third parties (the investors). Nothing in this Agreement shall be
            construed as a promise by Company to accept any investment or by Partner to procure any minimum amount of
            capital.
        </div>
        <div class="sub-section" style="text-align: justify;">
            <strong>7.5. Due Diligence and No Reliance.</strong>
            Company acknowledges that Partner is not obligated to investigate or perform due diligence on potential
            investors beyond basic qualification (such as accreditation status) unless otherwise agreed. Partner will
            not independently verify information about investors (such as their financial status or background) and
            shall not be liable for any investor’s performance or conduct. Conversely, Partner acknowledges that any
            information provided by Company about itself or the investment opportunity is the responsibility of Company,
            and Partner (and any prospective investor) should perform their own due diligence. Each Party has had the
            opportunity to consult with independent legal counsel and other advisors regarding this Agreement and the
            transactions contemplated, and enters into this Agreement with a full understanding of its terms and risks.

        <div class="sub-section">

            Indemnified Party”), from and against any and all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, costs, and expenses

            transaction related to an introduction (including any securities law violation in the offering process, or

            materials provided by Company to Partner or to any prospective investor (provided that such information is

            have resulted from the gross negligence, willful misconduct, or fraud of the Partner Indemnified Party

        </div>
        <div class="sub-section">
            <strong>8.2. Indemnification by Partner.</strong>Each Party represents that the performance of its
            obligations under this Agreement will not breach any other agreement to which it is a party or by which it
            is bound, and that it is not a party to any agreement in conflict with this Agreement. Partner specifically
            represents that Partner is not subject to any noncompete, non-solicitation, or other restriction that would

            Claim for which it seeks indemnification, provided that failure to give prompt notice shall not relieve the
            Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations except to the extent materially prejudiced by such
            delay. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume control of the defense of the Claim with
            counsel of its choice, provided such counsel is reputable and no conflict of interest exists, and the
            Indemnifying Party shall not settle any Claim without the Indemnified Party’s prior written consent (which
            shall not be unreasonably withheld) if such settlement imposes any liability or admission of fault on the
            Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in (but not control) the
            defense of the Claim with counsel of its own choosing at its own expense. The Parties shall cooperate in
            good faith in the defense of any Claim, and the Indemnified Party shall provide access to documents and
            information reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party for such defense.

            profits, loss of business opportunity, or loss of goodwill) arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
            the Services, even if such Party has been advised of the possibility of such damages. Each Party’s liability

            Party’s total cumulative liability to the other for any and all claims and damages arising out of or in
            connection with this Agreement shall not exceed the total amount of Commission fees paid (or payable) to

            without which the economic terms of this Agreement would be significantly different. The fees and
            compensation set forth in this Agreement reflect this allocation of risk and the limitation of liability

            not to pursue an introduction or to terminate negotiations with any prospective investor, nor shall Partner

            <strong>11.1. Governing Law.</strong> This Agreement and any dispute or claim (whether in contract, tort, or
            otherwise) arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be
            governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of [Insert Governing Law State], USA,
            without regard to its conflict of laws principles that would result in the application of the laws of
            another jurisdiction. The Parties specifically agree to exclude the application of the United Nations
            Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG) and any state laws adopting the Uniform
            Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA) to this Agreement.

            <strong>11.2. Jurisdiction and Venue.</strong>Each Party agrees that any legal action or proceeding arising
            out of or relating to this Agreement shall be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts located in
            Washington, DC (or, if Company’s principal place of business is in a different state, then in the state or
            federal courts of that jurisdiction). Each Party irrevocably submits to the personal jurisdiction of such
            courts and waives any objection on the grounds of lack of jurisdiction or forum non conveniens or any
            similar grounds. Each Party also agrees that service of process may be effected upon it by certified mail,
            return receipt requested, or by any method authorized under the laws of the forum. Nothing in this Section
            shall affect either Party’s right to seek injunctive relief or other equitable remedies in any appropriate
            jurisdiction to prevent or halt any actual or threatened breach of confidentiality or intellectual property
            rights.

            Party, in addition to any other relief granted.
